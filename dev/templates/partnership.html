                <p>• In order to start cooperation, it is necessary to register the cargo, indicating information about the contents of the cargo, its cost and quantity. And also attaching photographs to the application.</p>
                <p>• If you need to check the goods for compliance with the quantity, then when registering the cargo on our website, indicate this in the "Note" column. This service is paid and amounts to 3 yuan per item in the order. Any additional cargo checks are discussed individually, including their cost.</p>
                <p>• Before sending the cargo to our warehouse in China, be sure to make a mark with your order number on our website for each outer box so that we can identify your cargo. If you are unable to do this yourself, then ask your supplier about it.</p>

                        <p>• After sending the cargo to our warehouse in China, you must specify the tracking number for tracking parcels in China for each item in the order. You can enter the tracking number on the order page. The tracking number is another measure for identifying your cargo in our warehouse.</p>
                        <p>• If you have processed the cargo according to our instructions and done everything correctly, then upon receipt of your cargo at the warehouse in China, the order status will change to "In warehouse".</p>
                        <p>• When the cargo arrives at the warehouse and the order status changes, you will receive a notification to the email address you specified during registration. The letter will contain up-to-date information on the order, including the date of receipt, order number, and further steps for its processing.</p>
